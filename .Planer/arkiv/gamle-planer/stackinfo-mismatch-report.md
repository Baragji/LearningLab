# Stack Information Mismatch Report

This document identifies discrepancies between the information provided in `stackinfo.txt` and the actual implementation in the codebase.

## 1. Node.js Version

- **In stackinfo.txt**: `"nodeVersion": "20.12.2"`
- **Actual Implementation**:
  - `.node-version` file specifies `22`
  - `package.json` engines field specifies `"node": ">=22 <23"`

This is a significant mismatch as the project is actually using Node.js 22, not 20.12.2 as documented.

## 2. Framework Versions

### Next.js

- **In stackinfo.txt**: `"frontend": {"name": "Next.js", "version": "^14.1.0"}`
- **Actual Implementation**: `"next": "13.4.12"` in apps/web/package.json

This is a major version difference. The project is using Next.js 13.4.12, not version 14.1.0 as documented.

## 3. Prisma Version

- **In stackinfo.txt**:
  - `"versionCLI": "^5.22.0"`
  - `"versionClient": "^5.22.0"`
- **Actual Implementation**: `"prisma": "6.8.2"` in the root package.json

This is a significant version mismatch. The project is using Prisma 6.8.2, not version 5.22.0 as documented. Additionally, Prisma 6.x is not a publicly released version, suggesting a potential error in the package.json.

## 4. Workspaces Configuration

- **In stackinfo.txt**: Lists specific workspaces:
  ```
  "workspaces": [
    "apps/api",
    "apps/web",
    "packages/config",
    "packages/core",
    "packages/ui",
    "packages/tsconfig",
    "packages/create-solid-wow"
  ]
  ```
- **Actual Implementation**: Uses glob patterns:
  ```
  "workspaces": [
    "apps/*",
    "packages/*"
  ]
  ```

While the actual implementation will include all the workspaces listed in stackinfo.txt, the configuration approach is different.

## 5. Environment Variables

- **In stackinfo.txt**: Lists environment variables including `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` and `JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN`
- **Actual Implementation**: These refresh token variables are used in docker-compose.yml but not explicitly listed in stackinfo.txt

## 6. Testing Configuration

- **In stackinfo.txt**: Mentions Playwright for e2e testing
- **Actual Implementation**: Playwright is configured only in the web app, not for the entire project

## 7. Documentation Questions

The "åbneSpørgsmål" (open questions) section in stackinfo.txt asks:

- "Er .env.example template filer leveret for alle services?"

Our investigation found that .env.example exists only for the API app, not for the web app.

## 8. Additional Observations

1. **TypeScript Version**: The stackinfo.txt mentions different TypeScript versions for apps and packages, but the root package.json has a single TypeScript version (^5.8.3).

2. **Docker Configuration**: While stackinfo.txt correctly lists the Docker files, the docker-compose.yml doesn't include the web application as might be expected.

3. **Authentication Strategies**: The stackinfo.txt doesn't mention the authentication strategies (GitHub, Google) that are included as dependencies in the package.json.

## Recommendations

1. **Update Node.js Version**: Update stackinfo.txt to reflect the correct Node.js version (22).

2. **Correct Framework Versions**: Update the Next.js version in stackinfo.txt to match the actual version used (13.4.12).

3. **Verify Prisma Version**: Investigate the Prisma version discrepancy. If 6.8.2 is correct, update stackinfo.txt; if not, update the package.json.

4. **Standardize Workspace Documentation**: Either update stackinfo.txt to use glob patterns or ensure all specific workspaces are correctly listed.

5. **Complete Environment Variables**: Update stackinfo.txt to include all environment variables used in the project.

6. **Clarify Testing Scope**: Update the testing section to clarify that Playwright is used specifically for the web app.

7. **Answer Open Questions**: Provide answers to the open questions in stackinfo.txt based on the current state of the project.

8. **Add Authentication Information**: Update stackinfo.txt to include information about the authentication strategies used.

By addressing these mismatches, the stackinfo.txt file will become a more accurate and reliable reference for the project's technology stack and configuration.
