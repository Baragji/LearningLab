        "PROJEKTΟRAKEL_RESPONSIBILITY": [
            "1. Clearly instruct the agent to *assume* that the named process (e.g., 'WebAppServer') is running (possibly after a specified delay or manual user confirmation).",
            "2. Assign the task (e.g., `curl http://localhost:3000`) to an agent that can use a *new, fresh* `Terminal` instance for this interaction."

    }
]

# PROHIBITION: No agent may attempt to start a blocking process AND then send additional, independent commands in the SAME `Terminal` tool invocation. This will result in failure.
