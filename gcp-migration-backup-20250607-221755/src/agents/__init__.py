"""
Agentic RAG Framework

This module implements an autonomous agent-based RAG system with:
- QueryPlanner: Intelligent query decomposition and strategy selection
- RetrieverAgent: Adaptive retrieval with multiple strategies
- SynthesizerAgent: Multi-step reasoning and response synthesis
- ValidatorAgent: Response quality validation and refinement

The agentic approach enables:
- Autonomous decision-making in query processing
- Adaptive strategy selection based on query complexity
- Iterative refinement for improved accuracy
- Self-validation and error correction
