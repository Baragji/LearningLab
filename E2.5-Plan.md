To successfully complete E2.5, we need to focus on the integration and stabilization tasks outlined in the roadmap. Here's a detailed plan to achieve this:

Plan for E2.5 – Integration & Stabilitet
E2.5-1: Replace Mock Data with API Calls

Objective: Ensure all pages use fetchers in store/services/* to interact with the Nest API, eliminating static mock data.
Steps:
Identify all instances of mock data usage across the application.
Implement API calls for courses, modules, lessons, and quiz endpoints.
Refactor the code to replace mock data with dynamic data fetched from the API.
Test each page to ensure data is correctly fetched and displayed.
E2.5-2: New Pages - /my courses, /statistics, /settings

Objective: Develop new pages that load and display relevant data.
Steps:
Design and implement the /my courses page to show courses where the user has progress.
Create the /statistics page to display aggregated XP and scores per quiz.
Develop the /settings page for profile management and password reset.
Ensure each page fetches data correctly and handles loading states.
E2.5-3: Quiz Flow with Backend Attempt

Objective: Implement a robust quiz flow that interacts with the backend.
Steps:
On page load, initiate a GET request to /quiz/:id and a POST request to start a quiz attempt.
Allow users to answer questions, navigate through the quiz, and submit their answers.
Display scores and feedback upon submission.
Test the entire flow to ensure seamless interaction with the backend.
E2.5-4: ContentBlock Renderer v2

Objective: Enhance the lesson page to render different content types.
Steps:
Implement rendering logic for IMAGE_URL as responsive <img> elements.
Implement rendering logic for VIDEO_URL as <iframe> elements for YouTube/Vimeo.
Ensure the renderer handles various content types gracefully.
E2.5-5: SubjectArea Routing & Breadcrumbs

Objective: Implement subject area filtering and breadcrumb navigation.
Steps:
Fetch subject areas using GET /subject-areas and integrate filtering in the course list.
Implement breadcrumb navigation to show the path: SubjectArea → Course → Module → Lesson.
Test the routing and breadcrumb functionality for accuracy and usability.
Best Practices
Linting: Regularly run lint checks to ensure code quality and adherence to best practices.
Testing: Implement unit and integration tests for new features and changes.
Code Reviews: Conduct thorough code reviews to catch potential issues early.
By following this plan, we can ensure a smooth transition from mock data to a fully integrated and stable application.
