The various directories such as `apps`, `docs`, `packages`, and `prisma` suggest that this project is structured into separate components, each serving a specific purpose.\n\nSome file names provide hints about the nature of the project:\n\n* `MasterManual/`: This suggests that the project involves some kind of manual or tutorial.\n* `FASE_2_3_IMPLEMENTERING.md`: This file name mentions \"IMPLEMENTERING\", which means implementation in Danish. It's possible that this file is a documentation for implementing a specific feature or functionality.\n* `METAL_COMPILATION_FIX.md`: This suggests that the project involves working with metal compilation, possibly related to compiler development or optimization.\n* `kontekst.md`: This file name mentions \"kontekst\", which means context in Danish. It's possible that this file is a documentation for understanding the context of the project.\n\nOther files such as `Dockerfile.api` and `Dockerfile.web` suggest that the project involves containerization using Docker.\n\nThe presence of `.envrc` and `secrets/` directories suggests that the project requires sensitive information to be stored securely.\n\nOverall, this project appears to be a complex software development project that involves multiple technologies and tools. It's possible that it's related to developing an AI or machine learning model, given the presence of files such as `prisma/` and `packages/`.\n\nNext step would be to explore these directories and files in more detail using tools like `read_files` or `search_files`."
