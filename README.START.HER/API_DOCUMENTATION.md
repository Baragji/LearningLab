# üìù LearningLab API Documentation

This document provides an overview of the REST API used by LearningLab. The API is built with **NestJS** and is fully documented using **Swagger**. When the API server is running you can access the interactive documentation at:

```
http://localhost:5002/api/docs
```

If you use the Docker setup the docs are available through the Nginx reverse proxy at:

```
http://localhost/api/docs
```

## Base URL

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api` and versioned under `/api/v1`.

- Local development: `http://localhost:5002/api/v1`
- Production (via Nginx): `http://localhost/api/v1`

## Authentication

Authentication is handled with **JWT** tokens. Use the `/auth/login` endpoint to obtain an access token and refresh token. Include the access token in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>
```

Refresh tokens can be used with `/auth/refresh` to obtain new access tokens. Use `/auth/logout` to revoke tokens.

## Main Endpoints

The API exposes resources for:

- **Users** ‚Äì management of user accounts
- **Education programs** ‚Äì courses and lessons
- **Quizzes** ‚Äì assessments and questions
- **Progress** ‚Äì user progress tracking
- **Certificates** ‚Äì certificate generation
- **Search** ‚Äì global search across content
- **AI** ‚Äì AI powered helpers (question generation, summaries)

Each resource follows standard REST conventions with `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` operations. Detailed request and response examples are available in Swagger.

## Error Handling

Errors use standard HTTP status codes with a JSON body describing the error. Validation errors return status code `422` and include a list of field errors.

## Rate Limiting

The API uses rate limiting to prevent abuse. Unauthenticated requests are limited to **60** requests per minute while authenticated requests can perform up to **120** requests per minute.

## Pagination

List endpoints support pagination via the query parameters `page` and `limit`. The response contains metadata about total items and pages.

## Versioning

The current API version is **v1**. When a new version is released, older versions will remain available for a period of time to allow clients to migrate.
